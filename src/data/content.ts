    description: "LANGUAGE WATCH Foundation (LWF) is an independent, non-governmental organization based in Accra, Ghana, and was founded in 2016. Members of this association include; Linguists, professionals & practitioners of language, and communication experts. The team is led by Dr. Nana Anima Wiafe-Akenten, an Akan Linguist (the First PhD holder in Twi, GHLS). She is the founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).",

    longDescription: "This body understands and believes strongly that 'words' both the written and the spoken words are very powerful and must be handled carefully, in both interpersonal communication and in public settings, especially in media discourse. Words indeed can break, make or unmake. Like a knife in a doctors' hand; words can save life and can also kill. Thus, the need to be mindful of how sensitive and delicate words are and as such we use them properly/appropriately and in the right context/setting.",

    programs: "LANGUAGE WATCH Foundation (LWF) therefore embarks on programs that draw attention to the power of both the written and spoken words, especially; The LWF Outreach program. We also embark on training and seminars in speaking, reading and writing skills in our indigenous languages; #Suawokasa and #kasayie Campaign (for the young, youth and adult). We also offer individual and personal coaching programs on Voice & Speech, Speaking Skills (for personal & public) and Communicative Competence Skills.",

    center: "We therefore have an affiliated language center (Nananom language & media center) where one can acquire proficiency, fluency, public speaking skills and communicative competence in our Ghanaian languages (Akan, Ga, Ewe, Dagomba, Hausa, etc.) and in English as well. Also, available at the teaching and learning support center are translation, transcription, interpretation, creative writing services, etc.",

    quote: "The spoken word holds immense power, similar to a knife in a physician's hand. With the right words, one can bring life and with the wrong ones, cause harm. Words serve as keys, capable of unlocking doors or shutting them close. Simply, words can break, make and unmake and must be handled carefully.",

    description: "The LWF Outreach programs promote and encourage the use of decorous and polite language, especially in media, political, religious, domestic, health care, business settings and in all aspects of communication for national peace, stability and cohesion.",

    challenge: "Obviously, the liberalization of the airwaves and media pluralism in the country has broadened citizens' involvement and participation (panel discussions, phone-ins, txt messages, etc.) in governance and other critical sectors of the country/economy. Whereas media pluralism and citizens' participation have contributed significantly to information sharing, knowledge acquisition and national development among others, there is also a growing concern among a cross-section of Ghanaians about the use of intemperate language (words, phrases and sentences). The invectives, vulgar, inflammatory language used by some political figures, supporters, callers and panel members have the potential to inflame passions, incite others and create avoidable problems, confusion, and conflict.",

    solution: "As part of our contribution to national unity and solidarity, LWF Outreach creates awareness/sensitizes the general public to facilitate appropriate use of language for national peace, cohesion and development.",
