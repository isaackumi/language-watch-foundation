    quote: "The spoken word holds immense power, similar to a knife in a physician's hand. With the right words, one can bring life and with the wrong ones, cause harm. Words serve as keys, capable of unlocking doors or shutting them close. Simply, words can break, make and unmake and must be handled carefully.",

    challenge: "Obviously, the liberalization of the airwaves and media pluralism in the country has broadened citizens' involvement and participation (panel discussions, phone-ins, txt messages, etc.) in governance and other critical sectors of the country/economy. Whereas media pluralism and citizens' participation have contributed significantly to information sharing, knowledge acquisition and national development among others, there is also a growing concern among a cross-section of Ghanaians about the use of intemperate language (words, phrases and sentences). The invectives, vulgar, inflammatory language used by some political figures, supporters, callers and panel members have the potential to inflame passions, incite others and create avoidable problems, confusion, and conflict.",

    solution: "As part of our contribution to national unity and solidarity, LWF Outreach creates awareness/sensitizes the general public to facilitate appropriate use of language for national peace, cohesion and development.",
